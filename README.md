##  Features

###  Core Arithmetic
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus

###  Powers & Roots
- Squares and Cubes  
- Square Roots and Cube Roots  
- Exponentiation (`a^b`, `b^a`)  
- Exponential (`e^x`)

###  Trigonometric Functions
- sin, cos, tan (in degrees)  
- Inverse Trigonometric (asin, acos, atan ‚Üí in degrees)  
- Hyperbolic Trigonometric (sinh, cosh, tanh)

###  Logarithmic Functions
- Natural Log (`ln`)  
- Common Log (`log‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ`)  
- Logarithm with Custom Base

###  Factorials & Range
- Factorial of a number  
- Range Sum and Average between two numbers

###  Utility & Misc
- Absolute Values (`|a|`, `|b|`)  
- Percentage Calculation (`a% of b`)  
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) and LCM (Least Common Multiple)

---

##  Usage

###  Compile and Run
```bash
javac src/*.java
java src.CalculatorApp
```

Follow the on-screen menu to perform desired operations interactively.

---

##  Example
```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 3

Choose operation:
1: Addition (+)
2: Subtraction (-)
...
21: GCD and LCM

1
Sum = 8

Do you want to continue? (y/n): n
Thank you for using the calculator. Bye!
```

##  Notes
- Factorials are limited to values fitting within `long`.  
- Logarithms are valid only for positive inputs.  
- Division/modulus by zero is safely handled.  
- Inverse trigonometric functions are valid only for `a ‚àà [-1, 1]`.  
- Log base must be positive and ‚â† 1.  
- Output precision rounded to 4 decimal places.
